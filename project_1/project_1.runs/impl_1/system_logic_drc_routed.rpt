2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net pswd_reg/new_pswd_reg[11]_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin pswd_reg/new_pswd_reg[11]_i_1/O, cell pswd_reg/new_pswd_reg[11]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net pswd_reg/new_pswd_reg[15]_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin pswd_reg/new_pswd_reg[15]_i_1/O, cell pswd_reg/new_pswd_reg[15]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net pswd_reg/new_pswd_reg[3]_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin pswd_reg/new_pswd_reg[3]_i_1/O, cell pswd_reg/new_pswd_reg[3]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net pswd_reg/new_pswd_reg[7]_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin pswd_reg/new_pswd_reg[7]_i_1/O, cell pswd_reg/new_pswd_reg[7]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net pswd_reg/q_reg[11]_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin pswd_reg/q_reg[11]_i_1/O, cell pswd_reg/q_reg[11]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net pswd_reg/q_reg[15]_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin pswd_reg/q_reg[15]_i_1/O, cell pswd_reg/q_reg[15]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
